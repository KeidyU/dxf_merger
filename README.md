# dxf_merger

DFX Merger, just a function wrap based on ezdxf to merge n dxf files into a unique new dxf file.

## Requirements

- ezdxf (https://github.com/mozman/ezdxf)
- black code formatter (https://github.com/psf/black)

## How it works

Basically it uses ezdxf's add-on Importer to merge any dxf into an empty shell.

You can edit data.json file to change input folder+files, output folder+file.
